This project focused on the analysis, visualization, and reporting of global scope emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) using Power BI and Excel to enhance decision-making and drive sustainability efforts.

i. Scope 1 Emissions: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, such as company vehicles and facilities.
ii. Scope 2 Emissions: Indirect emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity.
iii. Scope 3 Emissions: Indirect emissions across the value chain, including business travel, supply chain activities, and waste.

Key Achievements:
i. Data Collection & Management: Compiled comprehensive emissions data from multiple sources across the organization using Excel, ensuring accuracy and consistency in tracking Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.
ii. Data Analysis: Leveraged Excel to perform in-depth analysis of emissions trends and identify key areas for improvement.
iii. Visualization & Reporting: Utilized Power BI to build interactive dashboards, providing real-time insights into emissions data. Visualizations included breakdowns by scope, geography, and emission source, making it easy for stakeholders to monitor progress.
iv. Strategic Insights: Generated reports that identified opportunities for reducing emissions, leading to actionable recommendations for energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and supply chain optimization.

Tools & Technologies:
i. Power BI: Created dynamic dashboards to visualize emissions data and present findings to senior management and sustainability teams.
ii. Excel: Managed data collection, performed calculations, and conducted detailed emissions analysis using advanced formulas and pivot tables.

Impact:
i. Streamlined emissions tracking and reporting processes, improving data accuracy and transparency.
ii. Enabled better decision-making by providing stakeholders with real-time, data-driven insights into emissions performance.
